Notes to keep in mind:

Python specific notes:
- The "sort" function is faster than the "sorted" function (determined via trial and error). Try to use the sort function wherever possible. 
- For knowing how to sort a list with a custom key, check the merge intervals problem (#56). 
- For knowing how to work with sets, check the 3Sum problem (#15).
