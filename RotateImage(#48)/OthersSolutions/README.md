Approach: Reverse on Diagonal and then Reverse Left to Right

Intuition

The most elegant solution for rotating the matrix is to firstly reverse the matrix around the main diagonal, and then reverse it from left to right. These operations are called transpose and reflect in linear algebra.

Bonus Question: What would happen if you reflect and then transpose? Would you still get the correct answer?

Bonus Question: If you're not too confident with matrices and linear algebra, get some more practice by also coding a method that transposes the matrix on the other diagonal, and another that reflects from top to bottom. You can test your functions by printing out the matrix before and after each operation. Finally, use your functions to find three more solutions to this problem. Each solution uses two matrix operations.

Interview Tip: Terrified of being asked this question in an interview? Many people are: it can be intimidating due to the fiddly logic. Unfortunately, if you do a lot of interviewing, the probability of seeing it at least once is high, and some people have claimed to have seen it multiple times! This is one of the few questions where I recommend practicing until you can confidently code it and explain it without thinking too much.
