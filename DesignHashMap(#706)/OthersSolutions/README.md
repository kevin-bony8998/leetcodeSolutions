Hashmap is a common data structure that is implemented in various forms in different programming languages, e.g. dict in Python and HashMap in Java. The most distinguish characteristic about hashmap is that it provides a fast access to a value that is associated with a given key.

There are two main issues that we should tackle, in order to design an efficient hashmap data structure: 1). hash function design and 2). collision handling.

1). hash function design: the purpose of hash function is to map a key value to an address in the storage space, similarly to the system that we assign a postcode to each mail address. As one can image, for a good hash function, it should map different keys evenly across the storage space, so that we don't end up with the case that the majority of the keys are concentrated in a few spaces.

2). collision handling: essentially the hash function reduces the vast key space into a limited address space. As a result, there could be the case where two different keys are mapped to the same address, which is what we call 'collision'. Since the collision is inevitable, it is important that we have a strategy to handle the collision.

Depending on how we deal with each of the above two issues, we could have various implementation of hashmap data structure.


Approach 1: Modulo + Array
Intuition

As one of the most intuitive implementations, we could adopt the modulo operator as the hash function, since the key value is of integer type. In addition, in order to minimize the potential collisions, it is advisable to use a prime number as the base of modulo, e.g. 2069.

We organize the storage space as an array where each element is indexed with the output value of the hash function.

In case of collision, where two different keys are mapped to the same address, we use a bucket to hold all the values. The bucket is a container that hold all the values that are assigned by the hash function. We could use either a LinkedList or an Array to implement the bucket data structure.

Algorithm

For each of the methods in hashmap data structure, namely get(), put() and remove(), it all boils down to the method to locate the value that is stored in hashmap, given the key.

This localization process can be done in two steps:

For a given key value, first we apply the hash function to generate a hash key, which corresponds to the address in our main storage. With this hash key, we would find the bucket where the value should be stored.

Now that we found the bucket, we simply iterate through the bucket to check if the desired <key, value> pair does exist.
